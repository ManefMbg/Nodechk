# Nodechk

In this checkpoint first i had to install node js then create a file named hello-world.js containing a code that "HELLO WORLD" to the console, after that i created a server with the port 3000 that responds with '<h1>Hello Node!!!!</h1>\n' when someone reaches http://localhost:3000. I also created a file named "password-generator" that has a function that generates random passwords and console.log() that password, finaly a file named email-sender with a code that sends emails to the user.
